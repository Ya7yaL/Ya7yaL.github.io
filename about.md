Hello, my name is Albilaga. I'm a [programmer](https://github.com/albilaga), [speaker](https://medium.com/dotnetid/membuat-chatbot-apps-menggunakan-bot-framework-dan-xamarin-f3aaad3f283), and also a [writer](https://albilaga.github.io). I work at Bandung  at [Radya Labs](http://radyalabs.com) as a Lead Xamarin Developer, but **this blog, its content and opinion are my own.** I blog mostly about technology and Xamarin specially, but sometimes also my journey as a human. I will try to blog on two languages English and Indonesian but I am not promising anything. I mostly use VS, VS4Mac, as my primary IDE and VSCode as my text editor and always use dark theme so that's why this site also have dark theme.

I only on [twitter](https://twitter.com/albilaga) and [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/albilaga). I don't have Facebook or Instagram because I don't believe in them to handle data and privacy.

If you want just to email me, you can send an email to albilaga.lp@gmail.com but be nice. I am not bite :)
